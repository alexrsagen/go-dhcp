# go-dhcp
(Unfinished) DHCP library, client and server written in Golang

Please note that this is an unfinished work and there might be bugs or missing features.

I am releasing it in the current state because while unfinished, parts of it may be useful for other people's own projects. I may continue working on the project myself in the future. Contributions/pull requests are also welcome.

The DHCPv4 library contains code that can create and parse DHCPv4 packets according to RFC2132 with options from RFC2132, RFC3004, RFC3011, RFC3046, RFC3118, RFC3203, RFC3397, RFC3442, RFC4388, RFC4391, RFC4702, RFC4833, RFC5417, RFC6926, RFC7724.
